# ðŸ“š Book Recommender System

This project is an interactive **Book Recommender System** built using **Python** and **Streamlit**, based on a collaborative filtering approach. It leverages real-world user ratings data to suggest books that are similar to a selected title, using **cosine similarity** between user rating vectors. The underlying dataset includes detailed metadata such as book titles, authors, publication years, publishers, and even cover image URLs, enabling both analytical and visual exploration.

The system filters out low-quality and sparse data to focus on meaningful ratings, ensuring high-quality recommendations. Once a user selects a book, the app returns a ranked list of the most similar titles along with their similarity scores. In addition to a summary table, it visually showcases each recommended bookâ€™s cover, author, publisher, and publication year â€” making the experience both informative and user-friendly.

Designed for both educational and practical use, this project demonstrates key concepts in recommendation systems, including data preprocessing, user-item matrix construction, similarity measurement, and interactive deployment. Itâ€™s ideal for anyone interested in building intelligent applications from real data, exploring collaborative filtering, or simply discovering new books.
